  "main.layout.description": "Software engineer who builds backend systems that drive real business impact. I specialize in Java Spring Boot, crafting scalable APIs and architectures that solve complex business problems. Whether it's reducing order processing time by 70%, accelerating development cycles by 5x, or cutting infrastructure costs by 40%, I focus on creating solutions that deliver measurable results, not just meet requirements. Transforming business needs into elegant, maintainable code is what drives me. I believe great software comes from deep technical understanding paired with a pragmatic mindset. Clean architecture,comprehensive testing, and systems designed to scale aren't just principles, they're how I work. Currently tackling challenging problems, contributing to meaningful products, and growing alongside talented engineers.",
